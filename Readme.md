Instructions:
    Simply open the client and server into seperate command windows. 
    Starting with the server, run it in the command window (change directories if needed) "server.py" and it will state that the server is running and waiting for a connection. 
    Next, in a new window, run the client, "client.py" on the cmd line, you will be prompted to enter the server's ip address, followed by the port number, (we used 5000 as the port) 
    Then if successful, you will be prompted to enter a query, if it doesnt match the three possible queries then your request will be rejected. Upon entering a correct query, you will be met with the information from the cluster that it had recieved from dataniz.

    Once finished, turn off server or end client and communications will cease.
